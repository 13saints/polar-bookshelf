# Aren't Electron Apps Bloated?

A default install of Polar uses about 350MB of RAM after a fresh start.

As of 2018 this is about $5 worth of RAM.

Electron and web apps provide for an amazingly powerful development platform.

Without PDF.js, React, Node, and other frameworks, it would be prohibitively 
expensive to re-implement Polar (and not very fun either).

Now add the cost of porting to Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android and iOS.  

You're asking to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars hiring a developer to 
save $5 on RAM.

It's just not a very practical solution.

I'd like to get memory consumption down. It's possible that there are some 
features we can remove but right now it's not a priority.

Just spend the extra $5...
