# TODO

- I need to REALLY grock firebase vs the realtime databse



# Questions

- how do I query for all documents for a user?

- how do I apply authorization for those documents?
    - can this auth be defeated in the client or do I have my own server 
      instance running for that
 
- If I go to cache first, will I get updates right after as the document is 
  updated?
  
- how do I do document updates? Maybe do another onDocumentLoaded event in the 
  model?  

- do FCM topics support queue'd data?
