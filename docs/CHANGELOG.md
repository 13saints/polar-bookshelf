  I need to take the time to build them correctly.  We have tar.

- Offset given to new windows so that it's not confused with the previous window.

- Better logging for additional performance. Default log level is INFO bug we 
  can change it later to WARN.  Include the source of the log event and the log
  level in messages now.

  queue based on time, progress, filtering by document title, sorting by document,
  pagination of the documents in your repository, and double clicking to open 
  a document.

- AppAnalytics now sends userAgent to Google Analytics so we can track OS, 
  Browser version, app version, etc.

  working properly.

  manageable now.

- Migrated to ASAR builds which should significantly improve performance on Windows
 
- 64bit and 32bit Windows builds now available.

- Flashcard input now fully working.

- Initial support for pagemarks that can be 'ignored' and have a state so that
  you can say that you're ignoring a whole section of a doc and not that it's

  before.

  some pdf.js bugs.
