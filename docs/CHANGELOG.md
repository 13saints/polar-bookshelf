# 1.0.0-beta100

- Capture now using webview by default for captured content. Should be much much
  more reliable and usable. Prevents crashes on Linux.
  
- Windows builds now dramatically smaller.  From 300MB down to 75MB.  

- Migrated to ASAR builds which should significantly improve performance on Windows
 
- 64bit and 32bit Windows builds now available.

- Capturing now more reliable if it is aborted by the user.  Electron used to
  lock up.   

- Initial Anki sync working

- Flashcard input now fully working.  

- Ability to set titles for a document

- Initial support for pagemarks that can be 'ignored' and have a state so that
  you can say that you're ignoring a whole section of a doc and not that it's 
  been 'read'.

- Image sync works for Anki and we properly handle media files.

- Better integration with your primary browser. If you click on a link in a 
  captured page it opens in your browser.
