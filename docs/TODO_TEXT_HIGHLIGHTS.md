- redraw them when the page resizes..
- store them in the backend
- ability to load them from the backend too.

- the placement is still having a problem creating a functional box
- ability to clear them (right client, "remove highlight")
- persist them in the metadata store

- for now.. don't build a UI for the notes... just create them, and add them...
  it's hacky but I can then start using the tool ...
