# "Click to Edit"

- Would be nice if we could 'click to edit' various fields in the UI.

# JSON Schema

Going to use AJV to validate our JSON input.

# Schema Forms

We're going to use:

https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form

as the basis for our form input.  It also uses ajv to validate the JSON so that
is a shared component we can use.


- it can use custom widgets for the input fields... I need to play with this and
  SimpleMDE..
