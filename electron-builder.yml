  # Linux: this option is not required, as the dock/window list icon is set via
  # the icon option in the BrowserWindow constructor. Please note that you need
  # to use a PNG, and not the OS X or Windows icon formats, in order for it to
  # show up in the dock/window list. Setting the icon in the file manager is not
  # currently supported.
