This system enables bulk file uploads with the following features:

- support drag and drop and the file browse dialog
- uploads of directories recursively when the user selects a directory
- filters types based on mime type and file extension
- progress indicators as a file is being uploaded
- tags are computed on directories so the directory structure is mirrored



TODO: 
  - FIXME: the progress callbacks don't currently work and they stay indeterminate
  - It would be great if you could drop the files on a directory in the sidebar
