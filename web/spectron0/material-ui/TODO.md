- table work:
    - cloud sync dialog is fucked - and isn't accurate... any longer

    - autocomplete needs to work for annotations again
        - must use the doc annotations a tthe bottom o the autocomplete widget
         - these never change

    - finish the rest of the dropdowns
  
    - search box needs a debouncer
    - search box layout sucks and is irrational when the close button is displayed
    - " no anotation selected" is too small
    - remove all references to Dialogs.tsx
    - dark mode pref
    - doc button in annotation preview is dumb... 
    - can not tag in the annotation preview view
    
    - item navigation (tab for each item??)
    - [enter] to open the currently selected item.


    - long click for context menu should work..

    - color dropdown has no clear
    - color dropdown can't highlight the blue as being selected... 
    - Dialog should blur the background via CSS blur like our current dialog 

    - move all MUI* classes out of the spectron directory

    - tooltips are transparent... also, give them a pointer if possible
    - key binding to toggle full-screen mode...
        
    - the macro checkbox at the top does NOT work with all the items on the page
    - port over the annotations page too
    - consider fixing the tree control too.
    - folder sidebar context menu is now broken 
    - events in the table aren't tied to the screen properly
    - login isn't in drak mode
    
- verify mobile UI works... 

- proper row handling

    - single click (with no modifiers) will select one row 


- test a full screen component so that light/dark mode can be used properly

- label on the right side of the node.

- font awesome icons working like MUI buttons
- blackout for when the tag completion pops up
- full text search button
- make toggle buttons
- DONE: drop down buttons 
- DONE: get a 'flex' style grid working
    - I can literally just use a div with display flex which is goood


- put the pagination at the top, along with multi-select items at the left... 


- TODO: dialog boxes need to be done right and have modals
