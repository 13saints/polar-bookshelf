- table work:
    - search box needs a debouncer
    - search box layout sucks and is irrational when the close button is displayed
    - don't think it's alignCenter 


    - long click for context menu should work..
    - put the related tags into the autocomplete widget directly since
      it maintains its own state. this will be a lot easier than refactoring it
    - remove all references to Dialogs.tsx
    - finish the rest of the dropdowns
    - the autocomplete needs to use the dialogs api
        - since this is now generic we can make it autocomplete books too
        - 
    - tooltips are transparent... also, give them a pointer if possible
    - 
        
    - the macro checkbox at the top does NOT work with all the items on the page
    - get tab navigation to work
    - port over the annotations page too
    - consider fixing the tree control too.
    - folder sidebar context menu is now broken 
    - events in the table aren't tied to the screen properly
              
    
- verify mobile UI works... 

- proper row handling

    - single click (with no modifiers) will select one row 


- test a full screen component so that light/dark mode can be used properly

- label on the right side of the node.

- font awesome icons working like MUI buttons
- blackout for when the tag completion pops up
- full text search button
- make toggle buttons
- DONE: drop down buttons 
- DONE: get a 'flex' style grid working
    - I can literally just use a div with display flex which is goood


- put the pagination at the top, along with multi-select items at the left... 


- TODO: dialog boxes need to be done right and have modals
