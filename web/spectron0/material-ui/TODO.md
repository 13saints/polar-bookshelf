- table work:
    - the header bar needs to work with delete and tag
    - header bar needs archive and flag too
    - unify the item handling functions... 
    - tag sorting doesn't work
    - progress sorting should be descending by default

- proper row handling

    - single click (with no modifiers) will select one row 


- test a full screen component so that light/dark mode can be used properly

- label on the right side of the node.

- font awesome icons working like MUI buttons
- blackout for when the tag completion pops up
- full text search button
- make toggle buttons
- DONE: drop down buttons 
- DONE: get a 'flex' style grid working
    - I can literally just use a div with display flex which is goood


- put the pagination at the top, along with multi-select items at the left... 


- TODO: dialog boxes need to be done right and have modals

-
