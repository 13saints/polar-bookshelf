- (DONE) the height of the form text area

- Paste WILL NOT work...  Paste works BUT the problem is that the generated
  content does not work with SimpleMDE .. which fucking sucks.

- Don't let SimpleMDE generate the label... it forces the label.

- Handle 'tab' safely... the problem right now is that it simply does prevents
  me from jumping to the next form element.
